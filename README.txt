I commited the files before I copied the link of the repository, when 
I tried to commit it said that there is nothing to commit, I asume it git 
saved the versions on my local machine but I'm still confused how I would 
go about sorting it out.

One solution I did was to create a complete copy of all the files and add
them manually to the generated folder from the github repository link with the
git clone <> command, now it seems to be working. ( i hope)
